# serverless-crud-http-api
This CRUD HTTP API is built using Terraform, DynamoDB, Lambda, and Python on AWS. It enables users to create, read, update, and delete items stored in a DynamoDB table through HTTP requests. Terraform is used to provision infrastructure resources, such as the API Gateway, DynamoDB table, and Lambda functions.
